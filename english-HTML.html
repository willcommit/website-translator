    <h2>Quad-antenna design for extreme accuracy</h2>
    <p>
      <span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif"
        >Utilizing four separate GNSS Antennas for the ultimate in
        responsiveness, the SCX-20 set a new standard for reliable and accurate
        heading for all of your marine electronics. Traditionally, a Satellite
        Compass™ calculates heading using one baseline between two antennas; the
        SCX-20 four antennas can calculate heading information using any one of
        the six baselines drawn between the four antennas. The unprecedented
        quad-antenna design of the SCX-20 makes it capable of calculating
        extremely accurate heading, pitch, roll, and heave information. It is
        the perfect heading solution for complex vessel installations where the
        view of satellites may sometimes be obstructed.</span

    <h2>Superior accuracy for all your sensors</h2>
    <p class="align-left">
      The SCX-20 enhances the performance of on-board equipment such as Radar,
      Fish Finders, Sonar, and Autopilots. Accurate heading information empowers
      your NAVpilot to keep a better course, saving time, fuel, and money on
      every voyage; meanwhile, precise pitch, roll, and heave information
      stabilizes the display for many Furuno Fish Finders and Sonars, allowing
      for an accurate presentation even in the roughest of seas. Radar Plotter
      True echo trails are available when the SCX-20 is connected to your Furuno
      Radar, helping to determine own ship’s movement as well as the movement of
      other vessels. Accurate speed and heading data ensures that target trails
      are displayed smoothly and accurately, without the jagged, zig-zag
      appearance common to compasses with a higher degree of deviation.

    <h2>Fish Finder</h2>
    <p class="align-left">
      Even in heavy seas, accurate heave compensation from SCX-20 enables Fish
      Finders such as the FCV-1150 or NavNet TZtouch/TZtouch2/TZtouch3 to show
      you an unwavering presentation of the seabed, without the undulations
      caused by sea conditions.

    <h1>Relay Critical Data</h1>
    <p>
      Effortlessly connect with existing Furuno systems in order to elevate your
      awareness of own vessel and the surrounding area by displaying critical
      information across several products including NavNet TZtouch MFD’s,
      NAVpilot-300, FI-70, and GP-39! Initial setup can be done from NavNet
      series MFD, NAVpilot-300 and GP-39.
